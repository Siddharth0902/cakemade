6 eggs, separated
1 cup sugar
3/4 cup King Arthur all-purpose flour*
2 tsp. baking powder

Preheat the oven to 350Â° F. Line the bottom of a 10-inch nonstick round cake pan or springform pan with parchment paper, then lightly grease 
with butter or shortening.

To make the sponge cake, blend the flour with the baking powder and set aside. In a large bowl, whip the egg whites until fluffy. Gradually 
add the sugar and beat until stiff peaks form. In a small bowl, beat the egg yolks until frothy and pale yellow. Fold the egg yolks and 
flour mixture into the egg whites.

Pour the batter into the pan and bake in the middle of the oven for 35-40 minutes, or until the center springs back when touched with a 
finger. Cool in the pan. (The center of the cake may sink slightly.) When cool, remove the cake from the pan and slice it into two layers.

*Different brands of flour can make a significant difference in the outcome of your sponge cake. King Arthur all-purpose flour is a great 
flour to use for this sponge cake because you get a cake with more volume.
